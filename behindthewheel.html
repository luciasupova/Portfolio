        <p class="p-caption">This project was focused on developing our <strong>own concept, sales platform and social
                media branding.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="h3-caption">The first part</h3>

        <p class="p-p">From the beginning we knew we wanted to work with sport cars. We came up with three different
            concepts (gas, hybrid, electric).
            But we needed other's opinion first.
            After a lot of research that consisted of desk research and interviews, we came up with our dream
            car concept that would sell well. We found out that people care about their future and they want to buy an
            <strong>electric sport car</strong>.
            <br> Before coming up with the first sketches and wireframes for our sales
            platform (website) we created Personas, User Journeys, Moodboards, and Business Model Canvas. </p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="h3-caption">The second part</h3>

    <p class="p-p">We focused on branding and creating social media plans. We created a Golden Circle, Concept Poster,
        Content Plan and upgraded the BMC. </p>

    <p class="p-p">Our main social platforms were Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. We prepared an Idea Catalogue with
        different
        types of content for each platform so we never run out of ideas. </p>

    <p class="p-p">Based on the feedback we got from user testing, we changed the following features; we made the action
        buttons more visible, updated the Dealership page, and added social media buttons together with our location.
        You can see them changed in the pictures below. </p>

    <h3 class="h3-caption">final website</h3>

    <p class="p-p"> We built the mobile version first with implemented dark mode and then made the webpage responsive to
        tablet, laptop, and
        desktop. In the picture below, you can see our <strong>HOME PAGE that I WAS IN CHARGE OF</strong>. We used three
        main colors; white, black – it’s a color of luxury and elegance, orange – the color of energy and movement. We
        followed the gestalt laws; proximity – the same objects are grouped together, alignment – objects are aligned
        according to the responsivity, color – it is distinguishable what is menu, action button and footer.</p>

    <p class="p-p"><strong>My role in the project:</strong> Coding, Web design, Visual Design, User-testing.</p>
