        <h3 class="h3-caption">The first part</h3>

        <p class="p-p">Our 1st dancing school was focused on Breakdance. At first, we did a lot of research about
            breakdance in general and later on, we had a few interviews with breakdancers. During this project, we got
            introduced to the design thinking process and personas and they both made our process much easier. This was
            the first project where we were taught to create a mobile-first solution, which was a bit difficult as it
            was our first time. By the end of the 2 weeks, we had to hand over our project to another group. </p>

    <p class="p-p">We got Bollywood and we had to redesign and elaborate on their work. </p>

    <p class="p-p">We focused on branding and creating social media plans. We created a Golden Circle, Concept Poster,
        Content Plan, Idea Catalogue and upgraded the BMC. </p>
