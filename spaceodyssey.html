        <p class="p-caption">This was a project focused on <strong> concept development and website</strong> for a
            fictional
            space program that sells outer space travels.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3-caption">The beginning</h3>

        <p class="p-p">This was our very first introduction to coding and web design. Honestly, no one from us had any
            previous experience so we decided to do whatever we could back. We came up with a concept we liked – a space
            travel agency that offers two different price packages. The Basic package included a trip around the Moon,
            Earth, and sunrise on Mars. If you want to travel across the Milky way or even beyond you are welcome to
            choose the VIP package. </p>

        <p class="p-p">And then we were just goofy and having fun with it while taking it seriously and trying to learn
            as much as we could. We created our sketches, name - <strong>FRONTIER</strong>, logo, we even created a
            photoshopped image of us – the crew who would take you on this awesome Space Odyssey.</p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="h3-caption">The Website</h3>

    <p class="p-p">Based on the sketches we created the website. In the following pictures, you can see the
        <strong>Home, Sign up, and Contact page</strong> from our Frontier website. We agreed on using a white font and
        black-white-blue-purplish color palette for our pages as they represent well the space colors, responsibility,
        and imagination.</p>

    <p class="p-p">I was in charge of the <strong>SIGN UP</strong> page. I had to create a page where potential clients
        would fill out their information and we would get back to them. I used a form and different inputs for creating
        this page. At the sides, I decided to put a mirrored picture of an astronaut. At the bottom, you can find a
        submit button. <br> Back then it was a huge thing that I created a website and I thought that that was it, how can
        someone improve quickly? There is no way. Well, look where we are now!</p>
