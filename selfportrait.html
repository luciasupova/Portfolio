        <p class="p-caption">A <strong> short movie </strong> based on the task to create a portrait about another
            person.
            I had to work with the entire production process behind the video, including: idea development and
            project management. It was my first introduction to the cinematic tools, video equipment and technical
            terms.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-caption">IDEA</h3>

        <p class="p-p">Each one of us plays a dirrerent character based on the comfort zone we have with other people.
            You are a different person when you are with your partner, boss or a stranger. The only person who really
            knows you is you.</p>

        <p class="p-p">So does Evita. Therefore, there are 3 different characters in the video. Evita as herself, as
            an actress and as a writer. </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="p-p">The project required that I worked ‘in the field‘. It was rather difficult because the set consisted only
        of her room that I have seen for the first time when we met for the shooting. I needed to create three different sets that would clearly show that she plays three
        different personas
        that fight for the spotlight. </p>

    <p class="p-p">The <strong>SOUL</strong> set has her photos from her life in the background. Flowers because she loves
        nature. And a hidden alien photo
        to indicate that this is her higher-self talking. She is also the one who is naming the things she likes while
        she is questioning what makes her being her.
    </p>

    <p class="p-p">
        Her <strong>ACTRESS</strong> persona is shown in front of a plain
        wall but it is desperately trying to merge with the soul persona.
    </p>
    <p class="p-p">
        The <strong>WRITER</strong> is in a dim light because she is hidden in the shadows. But by the end we find out that she 
        is the one controlling the whole narrative.
